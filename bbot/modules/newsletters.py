# Created a new module called 'newsletters' that will scrape the websites (or recursive websites,
# thanks to BBOT's sub-domain enumeration) looking for the presence of an 'email type' that also
# contains a 'placeholder'. The combination of these two HTML items usually signify the presence
# of an "Enter Your Email Here" type Newsletter Subscription service. This module could be used
# to find newsletters for a future email bombing attack.
