        Use this method to check whether a *host* is a wildcard entry

        This can reliably tell the difference between a valid DNS record and a wildcard within a wildcard domain.

        If you want to know whether a domain is using wildcard DNS, use `is_wildcard_domain()` instead.

        Args:
            query (str): The hostname to check for a wildcard entry.
            dns_children (dict, optional): Dictionary of {RDTYPE: [ip1, ip2]} to compare against, typically obtained from a previous DNS resolution of the query.
            rdtype (str, optional): The DNS record type (e.g., "A", "AAAA") to consider during the check.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary indicating if the query is a wildcard for each checked DNS record type.
                Keys are DNS record types like "A", "AAAA", etc.
                Values are tuples where the first element is a boolean indicating if the query is a wildcard,
                and the second element is the wildcard parent if it's a wildcard.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If only one of `dns_children` or `rdtype` is specified or if no valid IPs are specified.

        Examples:
            >>> is_wildcard("www.github.io")
            {"A": (True, "github.io"), "AAAA": (True, "github.io")}
