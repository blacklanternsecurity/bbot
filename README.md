### **BEEÂ·bot** is a multipurpose scanner inspired by [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot), built to automate your **Recon**, **Bug Bounties**, and **ASM**!

_A BBOT scan in real-time - visualization with [VivaGraphJS](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot-vivagraphjs)_

## Installation

```bash
# stable version
pipx install bbot

# bleeding edge (dev branch)
pipx install --pip-args '\--pre' bbot
```

_For more installation methods, including [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/blacklanternsecurity/bbot), see [Getting Started](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/)_

## Example Commands

### 1) Subdomain Finder

Passive API sources plus a recursive DNS brute-force with target-specific subdomain mutations.

```bash
# find subdomains of evilcorp.com
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p subdomain-enum
```

<!-- BBOT SUBDOMAIN-ENUM PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>subdomain-enum.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Enumerate subdomains via APIs, brute-force

flags:
  # enable every module with the subdomain-enum flag
  - subdomain-enum

output_modules:
  # output unique subdomains to TXT file
  - subdomains

config:
  dns:
    threads: 25
    brute_threads: 1000
  # put your API keys here
  modules:
    github:
      api_key: ""
    chaos:
      api_key: ""
    securitytrails:
      api_key: ""

```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT SUBDOMAIN-ENUM PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

BBOT consistently finds 20-50% more subdomains than other tools. The bigger the domain, the bigger the difference. To learn how this is possible, see [How It Works](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/how_it_works/).

### 2) Web Spider

```bash
# crawl evilcorp.com, extracting emails and other goodies
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p spider
```

<!-- BBOT SPIDER PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>spider.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Recursive web spider

modules:
  - httpx

config:
  web:
    # how many links to follow in a row
    spider_distance: 2
    # don't follow links whose directory depth is higher than 4
    spider_depth: 4
    # maximum number of links to follow per page
    spider_links_per_page: 25

```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT SPIDER PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

### 3) Email Gatherer

```bash
# quick email enum with free APIs + scraping
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p email-enum

# pair with subdomain enum + web spider for maximum yield
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p email-enum subdomain-enum spider
```

<!-- BBOT EMAIL-ENUM PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>email-enum.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Enumerate email addresses from APIs, web crawling, etc.

flags:
  - email-enum

output_modules:
  - emails

```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT EMAIL-ENUM PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

### 4) Web Scanner

```bash
# run a light web scan against www.evilcorp.com
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -p web-basic

# run a heavy web scan against www.evilcorp.com
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -p web-thorough
```

<!-- BBOT WEB-BASIC PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>web-basic.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Quick web scan

include:
  - iis-shortnames

flags:
  - web-basic

```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT WEB-BASIC PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<!-- BBOT WEB-THOROUGH PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>web-thorough.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Aggressive web scan

include:
  # include the web-basic preset
  - web-basic

flags:
  - web-thorough

```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT WEB-THOROUGH PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

### 5) Everything Everywhere All at Once

```bash
# everything everywhere all at once
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p kitchen-sink

# roughly equivalent to:
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p subdomain-enum cloud-enum code-enum email-enum spider web-basic paramminer dirbust-light web-screenshots
```

<!-- BBOT KITCHEN-SINK PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

<details>
<summary><b><code>kitchen-sink.yml</code></b></summary>

```yaml
description: Everything everywhere all at once

include:
  - subdomain-enum
  - cloud-enum
  - code-enum
  - email-enum
  - spider
  - web-basic
  - paramminer
  - dirbust-light
  - web-screenshots

config:
  modules:
    baddns:
      enable_references: True



```

</details>

<!-- END BBOT KITCHEN-SINK PRESET EXPANDABLE -->

## BBOT as a Python Library

#### Synchronous
```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

scan = Scanner("evilcorp.com", presets=["subdomain-enum"])
for event in scan.start():
    print(event)
```

#### Asynchronous
```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

async def main():
    scan = Scanner("evilcorp.com", presets=["subdomain-enum"])
    async for event in scan.async_start():
        print(event.json())

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Feature Overview

- Support for Multiple Targets
- Web Screenshots
- Suite of Offensive Web Modules
- NLP-powered Subdomain Mutations
- Native Output to Neo4j (and more)
- Automatic dependency install with Ansible
- Search entire attack surface with custom YARA rules
- Python API + Developer Documentation

## Targets

BBOT accepts an unlimited number of targets via `-t`. You can specify targets either directly on the command line or in files (or both!):

```bash
bbot -t evilcorp.com evilcorp.org 1.2.3.0/24 -p subdomain-enum
```

Targets can be any of the following:

- `DNS_NAME` (`evilcorp.com`)
- `IP_ADDRESS` (`1.2.3.4`)
- `IP_RANGE` (`1.2.3.0/24`)
- `OPEN_TCP_PORT` (`192.168.0.1:80`)
- `URL` (`https://www.evilcorp.com`)

For more information, see [Targets](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#targets-t). To learn how BBOT handles scope, see [Scope](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#scope).

## API Keys

Similar to Amass or Subfinder, BBOT supports API keys for various third-party services such as SecurityTrails, etc.

The standard way to do this is to enter your API keys in **`~/.config/bbot/bbot.yml`**:
```yaml
modules:
  shodan_dns:
    api_key: 4f41243847da693a4f356c0486114bc6
  c99:
    api_key: 21a270d5f59c9b05813a72bb41707266
  virustotal:
    api_key: dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
  securitytrails:
    api_key: d9a05c3fd9a514497713c54b4455d0b0
```

If you like, you can also specify them on the command line:
```bash
bbot -c modules.virustotal.api_key=dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
```

For details, see [Configuration](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/configuration/).
