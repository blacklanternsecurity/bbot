# Output

By default, BBOT saves its output in TXT, JSON, and CSV formats. The filenames are logged at the end of each scan:
![bbot output](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot/assets/20261699/bb3da441-2682-408f-b955-19b268823b82)

Every BBOT scan gets a unique and mildly-entertaining name like **`demonic_jimmy`**. Output for that scan, including scan stats and any web screenshots, etc., are saved to a folder by that name in `~/.bbot/scans`. The most recent 20 scans are kept, and older ones are removed. You can change the location of BBOT's output with `--output`, and you can also pick a custom scan name with `--name`.

If you reuse a scan name, it will append to its original output files and leverage the previous.

## Output Modules

Multiple simultaneous output formats are possible because of **output modules**. Output modules are similar to normal modules except they are enabled with `-om`.

### Human

`human` output is tab-delimited, so it's easy to grep:

```bash
# grep out only the DNS_NAMEs
cat ~/.bbot/scans/extreme_johnny/output.txt | grep '[DNS_NAME]' | cut -f2
evilcorp.com
www.evilcorp.com
mail.evilcorp.com
```

### CSV

The `csv` output module produces a CSV like this:

| Event type | Event data              | IP Address | Source Module | Scope Distance | Event Tags                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DNS_NAME   | evilcorp.com            | 1.2.3.4    | TARGET        | 0              | a-record,cdn-github,distance-0,domain,in-scope,mx-record,ns-record,resolved,soa-record,target,txt-record |
| DNS_NAME   | www.evilcorp.com        | 2.3.4.5    | certspotter   | 0              | a-record,aaaa-record,cdn-github,cname-record,distance-0,in-scope,resolved,subdomain                      |
| URL        | http://www.evilcorp.com | 2.3.4.5    | httpx         | 0              | a-record,aaaa-record,cdn-github,cname-record,distance-0,in-scope,resolved,subdomain                      |
| DNS_NAME   | admin.evilcorp.com      | 5.6.7.8    | otx           | 0              | a-record,aaaa-record,cloud-azure,cname-record,distance-0,in-scope,resolved,subdomain                     |

### JSON

If you manually enable the `json` output module, it will go to stdout:

```bash
bbot -t evilcorp.com -om json | jq
```

You will then see [events](events.md) like this:

```json
{
  "type": "IP_ADDRESS",
  "id": "IP_ADDRESS:13cd09c2adf0860a582240229cd7ad1dccdb5eb1",
  "data": "1.2.3.4",
  "scope_distance": 1,
  "scan": "SCAN:64c0e076516ae7aa6502fd99489693d0d5ec26cc",
  "timestamp": 1688518967.740472,
  "resolved_hosts": ["1.2.3.4"],
  "source": "DNS_NAME:2da045542abbf86723f22383d04eb453e573723c",
  "tags": ["distance-1", "ipv4", "internal"],
  "module": "A",
  "module_sequence": "A"
}
```

You can filter on the JSON output with `jq`:

```bash
# pull out only the .data attribute of every DNS_NAME
$ jq -r 'select(.type=="DNS_NAME") | .data' ~/.bbot/scans/extreme_johnny/output.ndjson
evilcorp.com
www.evilcorp.com
mail.evilcorp.com
```

### Discord / Slack / Teams

![bbot-discord](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot/assets/20261699/6d88045c-8eac-43b6-8de9-c621ecf60c2d)

BBOT supports output via webhooks to `discord`, `slack`, and `teams`. To use them, you must specify a webhook URL either in the config:

```yaml title="~/.bbot/config/bbot.yml"
output_modules:
  discord:
    webhook_url: output_modules.discord.webhook_url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234/deadbeef
```

...or on the command line:
```bash
bbot -t evilcorp.com -om discord -c output_modules.discord.webhook_url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234/deadbeef
```

By default, only `VULNERABILITY` and `FINDING` events are sent, but this can be customized by setting `event_types` in the config like so:

```yaml title="~/.bbot/config/bbot.yml"
output_modules:
  discord:
    event_types:
      - VULNERABILITY
      - FINDING
      - STORAGE_BUCKET
```

...or on the command line:
```bash
bbot -t evilcorp.com -om discord -c output_modules.discord.event_types=["STORAGE_BUCKET","FINDING","VULNERABILITY"]
```

You can also filter on the severity of `VULNERABILITY` events by setting `min_severity`:


```yaml title="~/.bbot/config/bbot.yml"
output_modules:
  discord:
    min_severity: HIGH
```

### HTTP

The `http` output module sends [events](events.md) in JSON format to a desired HTTP endpoint.

```bash
# POST scan results to localhost
bbot -t evilcorp.com -om http -c output_modules.http.url=http://localhost:8000
```

You can customize the HTTP method if needed. Authentication is also supported:

```yaml title="~/.bbot/config/bbot.yml"
output_modules:
  http:
    url: https://localhost:8000
    method: PUT
    # Authorization: Bearer
    bearer: <bearer_token>
    # OR
    username: bob
    password: P@ssw0rd
```

### Splunk

The `splunk` output module sends [events](events.md) in JSON format to a desired splunk instance via [HEC](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.0/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).

You can customize this output with the following config options:

```yaml title="~/.bbot/config/bbot.yml"
output_modules:
  splunk:
    # The full URL with the URI `/services/collector/event`
    url: https://localhost:8088/services/collector/event
    # Generated from splunk webui
    hectoken: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    # Defaults to `main` if not set
    index: my-specific-index
    # Defaults to `bbot` if not set
    source: /my/source.json
```

### Asset Inventory

The `asset_inventory` module produces a CSV like this:

| Host               | Provider    | IP(s)   | Status | Open Ports |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| evilcorp.com       | cdn-github  | 1.2.3.4 | Active | 80,443     |
| www.evilcorp.com   | cdn-github  | 2.3.4.5 | Active | 22,80,443  |
| admin.evilcorp.com | cloud-azure | 5.6.7.8 | N/A    |            |

### Subdomains

The `subdomains` output module produces simple text file containing only in-scope and resolved subdomains:

```text title="subdomains.txt"
evilcorp.com
www.evilcorp.com
mail.evilcorp.com
portal.evilcorp.com
```

## Neo4j

Neo4j is the funnest (and prettiest) way to view and interact with BBOT data.

![neo4j](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot/assets/20261699/0192d548-5c60-42b6-9a1e-32ba7b921cdf)

- You can get Neo4j up and running with a single docker command:

```bash
# start Neo4j in the background with docker
docker run -d -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -v "$(pwd)/neo4j/:/data/" -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/bbotislife neo4j
```

- After that, run bbot with `-om neo4j`

```bash
bbot -f subdomain-enum -t evilcorp.com -om neo4j
```

- Log in at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) with `neo4j` / `bbotislife`

### Cypher Queries and Tips

Neo4j uses the Cypher Query Language for its graph query language. Cypher uses common clauses to craft relational queries and present the desired data in multiple formats. 

Cypher queries can be broken down into three required pieces; selection, filter, and presentation. The selection piece identifies what data that will be searched against - 90% of the time the "MATCH" clause will be enough but there are means to read from csv or json data files. In all of these examples the "MATCH" clause will be used. The filter piece helps to focus in on the required data and used the "WHERE" clause to accomplish this effort (most basic operators can be used). Finally, the presentation section identifies how the data should be presented back to the querier. While neo4j is a graph database, it can be used in a traditional table view.

A simple query to grab every URL event with ".com" in the BBOT data field would look like this:
`MATCH (u:URL) WHERE u.data contains ".com" RETURN u`

In this query the following can be identified:
- Within the MATCH statement "u" is a variable and can be any value needed by the user while the "URL" label is a direct relationship to the BBOT event type.
- The WHERE statement allows the query to filter on any of the BBOT event properties like data, tag, or even the label itself. 
- The RETURN statement is a general presentation of the whole URL event but this can be narrowed down to present any of the specific properties of the BBOT event (`RETURN u.data, u.tags`).

The following are a few recommended queries to get started with:

```cypher
// Get all "in-scope" DNS Nodes and return just data and tags properties
MATCH (n:DNS_NAME)
WHERE "in-scope" IN n.tags
RETURN n.data, n.tags
```

```cypher
// Get the count of labels/BBOT events in the Neo4j Database
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n), count(n)
```

```cypher
// Get a graph of open ports associated with each domain
MATCH z = ((n:DNS_NAME) --> (p:OPEN_TCP_PORT))
RETURN z
```

```cypher
// Get all domains and IP addresses with open TCP ports
MATCH (n) --> (p:OPEN_TCP_PORT)
WHERE "in-scope" in n.tags and (n:DNS_NAME or n:IP_ADDRESS)
WITH *, TAIL(SPLIT(p.data, ':')) AS port
RETURN n.data, collect(distinct port)
```

```cypher
// Clear the database
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n
```

This is not an exhaustive list of clauses, filters, or other means to use cypher and should be considered a starting point. To build more advanced queries consider reading Neo4j's Cypher [documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/). 

Additional note: these sample queries are dependent on the existence of the data in the target neo4j database.
